***Check [wp-cli](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli)***

I started hacking on `worsh` when I was still unaware of the existence of wp-cli, which is a great tool and project.

# worsh - the WordPress Shell


*aka The redneck way to pronounce the word "Wash"*


WordPress Shell, inspired by [drush](http://drush.org/), the super powerful Drupal shell.

Enough of phpmyadmin? Or twiddling with WordPress backend interface?
Do you want the power of shell to manage your WordPress websites?


After the mixed joy and disappointment caused by wp-cli's existence I filled up the void by creating  [mewsh](http://mewsh.org/), a MediaWiki Shell.
