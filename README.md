# worsh - the WordPress Shell


WordPress Shell, inspired by drush.

Enough of phpmyadmin? Or twiddling with WordPress backend interface?
Do you want the power of shell to manage your WordPress websites?

**worsh** is not there, yet. But inspired by Drupal's drush we should
get something useful pretty fast.


## installation

You could create a convenient symlink:

    cd /usr/local/bin
    ln -s ~/worsh/worsh.php worsh



## Commands

**worsh** is brand new. By far not as powerful as drush, but here are
some commands that are supposed to work that can come in handy at times.


### oget

    worsh oget siteurl




### sql-dump

    worsh sql-dump
